### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience âœŒ 
The main programming languages I work with are Java and Python for backend development, but I'm deeply fascinating about A.I. which I plan to continue studying, and the Flutter framework for mobile apps (and more ðŸ˜œ). 

Here you can check my [Resume](https://github.com/marcojoe94/resume) ðŸ‘ˆ

I hope to join some Open Source project really soon. I also have some personal projects in mind that I'll likely  share as soon as I'm able, so stay tuned ðŸ˜‰

Here you can find a discord server I created for remote workers, in order to help each others and share some virtual coffies â˜• ðŸ‘‰ [SharedDesks](https://discord.gg/GzKEw5bX)
